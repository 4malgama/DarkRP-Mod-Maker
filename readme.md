# DarkRP Mod Maker
This is a simple program for comfortable and quick creation of all the necessary configuration for the servers of the game Garry's Mod, based on DarkRP.
You will be able to create everything that should be in darkrp_customthings. For example, you can create an unlimited number of works, categories, ammo, etc. in a convenient graphical interface.
### Relevance
The game is becoming more and more popular every day. And the number of servers in it is growing as fast as the number of people who want to create their own server.
However, it takes a lot of time to create simple and elementary things, like a list of professions.
And this program perfectly compensates for these shortcomings.
### Who will it be useful for?
**Beginers** --- For many novice coders in the Lua language, it is really difficult sometimes to understand certain properties of this language. And mistakes may be made that are quite capable of withdrawing newcomers from the whole idea of the server.
**Advanced** --- Even among experienced Lua users and coders, there are many people who feel dissatisfied and stressed when faced with such routine tasks, such as writing a config for servers, including adding weapons, ammunition, etc.
### How to use these?
It's very simple:
1. You run the only one ".EXE" file.
2. Next, select the appropriate tab for your needs.
3. Fill in the required fields.
4. Press the green "+" button in the upper-right corner.
5. Repeat 2-4 steps with the remaining tabs as needed.
6. As soon as you finish creating the config, you can see everything you have done: **[Shift + V]** or **Window → Viewer**.
7. Select the path to save: **Edit → Settings.** Don't worry, all your settings are saved after clicking the "Apply" button.
8. Export. **File → Export all.**
9. Profit.
